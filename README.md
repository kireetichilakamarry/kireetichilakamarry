### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Kireeti Chilakamarry, and I'm a highly motivated and ambitious student at UC Berkeley pursuing a dual degree in Computer Science and Statistics. I intend on applying my education and skills to make meaningful contributions to the field of financial technology. In my free time, I enjoy working out, playing guitar, and going on bike rides with my close friends.
